# Imago

Image sharing website.

https://onlava.github.io/Imago/

## General overview

Imago is a frontend site with a little backend functionality. The main focus of creating it was as a clone of https://unsplash.com, which is also an image sharing website. 

### Backend

Users may upload images, however, they are not stored and do not actually display. Users may login and register but their account will not exist after refreshing. Any backend parts of the project were to enhance frontend portions.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The web framework used
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons
* [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/) - Lightweight CSS animations
* [UIGradients](https://uigradients.com/) - Gradients

## Contributing

Imago is not open to contribution as it is purely for frontend design experimentation and not as a functional site.
